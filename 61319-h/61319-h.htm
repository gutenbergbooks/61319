<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">FOREWORD</span></h2>
<p>More and more people are turning to the outdoors and the enjoyment
of nature. Many great Americans have been students of wild
birds. This is not accidental, for few forms of outdoor recreation
offer so much pleasure.</p>
<p>The <i>season</i> of the year will in some cases determine what birds
are in your area. <i>Color</i> is important in identifying species. Look carefully
at the <i>silhouette</i> or <i>shape</i>; is it slender or chunky, is the tail
short or long? Compare its <i>size</i> with a bird with which you are more
familiar. <i>Habitat</i> is important, too. One learns to look for Red-winged
Blackbirds in wet marshes; for a meadowlark in pastures and fields.
<i>Behavior</i> is a clue. Does it walk or hop; does it soar, does it walk
headfirst down a tree, as is the habit of the nuthatch, or scratch
among leaves like the towhee? Listen to the bird&rsquo;s <i>song</i> and <i>call
note</i>. With a little experience, distinctive songs may be identified.
Each bird has its characteristic song.</p>
<p>Bird study can be pursued with as much effort as the watcher
cares to exert. Birds need food, water and protection from their
natural enemies. You can provide these in your own yard. Some
birds will be attracted and you can study them at your leisure. Other
species, those which live in swamps, for example, must be searched
for aggressively.</p>
<p>A bird guide is a splendid investment, considering the hours of
pleasure it will bring you. Binoculars are a help, too, in studying the
size, shape, beak, legs and color pattern.</p>
<p>Make written notes of what you see and hear, or a dated list of
species and numbers of each. Records will add to your own pleasure
and add to the sum of knowledge on birds in general.</p>
<p>This is the first of two booklets on common birds of the United
States published by Capper Publications, Inc. Each of the two volumes
illustrates and describes 50 different species. Additional copies
(specify whether volume I or II is desired) may be ordered for 25
cents each as follows:</p>

<br /><i>Podilymbus podiceps</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="375" height="382" />
</div>
<p>It makes little difference to this bird whether
you call him &ldquo;Water-witch, Hell-diver, Dabchick
or Pied-billed Grebe,&rdquo; for these are only a few of
the names by which he is known. His only concern
is finding a pond, lake or other water, well
supplied with crayfish, minnows or insects on
which he feeds. Leeches are a favorite morsel.</p>
<p>The short, thick bill of this grebe is distinctive,
even in winter when the black encircling
band from which it gets its name, is missing.
General appearance is brown, being brownish-black
above, lighter brown and white below. On
water the short tail usually is carried high
enough to show the white under-tail coverts.</p>
<p>This grebe is perfectly adjusted to water and
can swim, dive or lower his body in water just
as far as desired with little effort, often showing
only bill and eyes above the surface. This
protects him from predators or hunters who
might mistake him for a duck. Even his nest
is a floating structure so placed that he can gain
the safety of his natural element.</p>
<p>Wet pavements are hazardous for they resemble
water and if the Pied-billed Grebe lands
there, he is helpless. His legs are placed too
far back on his body for walking and he finds it
difficult to regain the air except by skittering
over water.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He sinks or dives</p>

<h3 id="c3">Great Blue Heron
<br /><i>Ardea herodias</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01a.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="456" height="524" />
</div>
<p>Altho protected by the Federal Migratory
Bird Treaty, this heron often finds himself the
target for thoughtless hunters. Not that he
would make a tasty dish, but any bird which
stands 4 feet high with a wing spread of almost
70 inches is in constant danger. His favorite
feeding grounds are wet meadows or pastures,
ponds, lakes or streams. Most of his food consists
of rough fish which he catches expertly,
either standing patiently in shallow water until
a fish appears, or walking slowly along the edge
of some shallow pond until he discovers his
prey. Snakes, frogs, insects, mice, eels, or even
small birds are not safe from a hungry heron.</p>
<p>Unlike cranes, which fly with necks outstretched,
herons fold their necks back as if
resting their heads on their shoulders. Their
flight is a slow, measured beat which carries
them to their destination. These birds seem to
prefer tops of tall trees, such as sycamores or
cottonwoods, either in isolated locations or on
islands. Favorite sites are used year after year
and nests often cover as much as 3 feet in space
and are placed well out on limbs. A colony of
Great Blue Herons is frequently joined by herons
of other species. Such a colony of fish-eating
birds is both noisy and odorous.</p>
<div class="verse">

<h3 id="c4">Snow Goose
<br /><i>Chen hyperborea</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="472" height="510" />
</div>
<p>This medium-size goose is the most abundant
member of the family and can be identified by
white plumage and black wing tips. He is often
called &ldquo;wavy,&rdquo; in the northern part of his range,
while southern hunters refer to him as a &ldquo;white
brant.&rdquo; His Latin name describes him as &ldquo;a
goose beyond the north wind.&rdquo; We see him only
as a migrant, either going to nesting grounds in
Northern Canada or returning to his winter
home on the coast of Louisiana and Texas. A
somewhat larger relative known as the Greater
Snow Goose, nests in Northern Greenland and
winters along our Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>This bird feeds on roots and bulbs of water
plants found in his wintering area. Grasses,
grains or other vegetation bring huge flocks
where they can be seen grazing like tame geese.
Feeding flocks are not welcome to the wheat
grower who has fields near lakes which are used
as resting places for migrating birds.</p>
<p>Snow Geese often travel with their near relatives,
the Blue Geese. The gray body and white
head of the latter give a color contrast which
is apparent in a mixed flock. These birds interbreed
frequently and their offspring are confusing
but usually show more white on the breast
than the Blue Goose parent.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Like mammoth flakes of drifting snow</p>
<p class="t0">We see you come, we watch you go</p>

<h3 id="c5">Common Mallard
<br /><i>Anas platyrhynchos</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="460" height="499" />
</div>
<p>The Mallard drake with green head, purple
chestnut breast, reddish feet, white collar, black
and white tail with a curled feather, combine
to make a colorful duck. The female, more in
keeping with her motherly duties, is content to
wear a trim suit of buffy gray, streaked with
brown. The orange to greenish-olive bill and
pale orange-red feet give perfect clues to her
identity.</p>
<p>Any pond, puddle, lake or stream is not overlooked
by this bird and he is especially fond of
shallow water where he can secure food by tipping
up and extending his neck to muddy bottoms.
These ducks are good divers but if not
closely pressed, seem to dive only for pleasure.</p>
<p>The Mallard is not a good father, but leaves
his mate soon after she has started to incubate
her eggs. Her nest is well hidden and often
found some distance from water. Her downy
young soon can travel and the proud mother
leads them to the nearest body of water as soon
as possible. These trips are hazardous, for predators
relish such dainty morsels. Turtles and
fish also take their toll.</p>
<p>Hunters look forward to the fall flight of
these ducks for they furnish a major portion
of the annual duck harvest. They soon learn
that guns are dangerous and often feed at night.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh, green-head, with your yellow bill,</p>
<p class="t0">Your rapid flight gives us a thrill</p>
<p class="t0">And when we hear your mate&rsquo;s loud quack</p>

<h3 id="c6">Turkey Vulture
<br /><i>Cathartes aura</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="426" height="588" />
</div>
<p>Vultures play an unusual part in nature&rsquo;s
drama. They, along with Sexton Beetles, other
insects and animals, form the sanitary unit.
When we consider the heavy toll of wildlife
along our highways, we can appreciate the usefulness
of such a unit. Lacking talons, vultures
are not equipped to catch their prey, but feed
on whatever nature provides.</p>
<p>This vulture is almost eagle size, with a wingspread
of 70 inches and can be identified by his
long tail, small head, 2-toned wings, and habit
of soaring, the wings forming a dihedral or open
V-shape. On close inspection, you will find the
head bare and a reddish color. The young have
blackish heads which is one of the marks of the
Black Vulture, but the latter is smaller with a
square tail and shows white spots under the
wing when flying. This is a southern cousin.</p>
<p>No other land bird soars so gracefully. Every
air current carries this bird with little effort on
his part. From high in the air, he scans vast
areas for food, not forgetting to check his neighbors
who are riding other currents in like manner.
When one bird descends, every vulture in
the air soon joins him.</p>
<p>Whether you call him &ldquo;Turkey Buzzard, Carrion
Crow or Turkey Vulture,&rdquo; you will admire
his flight.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Black omen floating far o&rsquo;erhead,</p>
<p class="t0">Your mission, to remove the dead.</p>
<p class="t0">A useful bird, we must agree</p>

<h3 id="c7">Red-tailed Hawk
<br /><i>Buteo jamaicensis</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="420" height="636" />
</div>
<p>Red-tails, like other hawks, show a great
variation in plumage. The dark phase of a
Western Red-tail compares favorably with the
plumage of an adult Golden Eagle, but the
smaller size and the reddish upper tail surface
which reflects the sun as the bird soars, furnishes
the clue. Typical plumage shows a dark
belly-band with bright, reddish upper tail, while
some birds show a light breast and belly.</p>
<p>This bird prefers open woodlands or a dead
tree with fields adjoining. There he may sit for
hours, but ever watchful for some movement
which might indicate the presence of a gopher,
field mouse, rat or even a snake. All add to his
varied menu. Rodents soon become pests when
these hawks are scarce. This bird often is killed
by farmers and poultry raisers when the real
culprit, the Cooper&rsquo;s Hawk, lives on to enjoy
the flock.</p>
<p>The Red-tail&rsquo;s size and habit of perching in
exposed places make him a ready target for
anyone who carries a gun. Slow flight combined
with his habit of soaring also add to his high
death rate.</p>
<p>He adds a few sprigs of green foliage to the
mass of sticks, which goes to make his nest,
usually placed in a tall tree near the edge of
timber.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Your great broad wings, red, fan-shaped tail,</p>

<h3 id="c8">Sparrow Hawk
<br /><i>Falco sparverius</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="450" height="448" />
</div>
<p>This little falcon, about the size of a Robin,
is also known as Kestrel. Calling him a Sparrow-hawk
is misleading, for insects and spiders,
along with a generous portion of mice, go to
make up his daily fare. Grasshoppers seem to
be a special delicacy. Like other birds, he feeds
on whatever is available. In cities, this includes
English Sparrows.</p>
<p>The smallest of the hawk family can be found
along highways where he uses telephone poles,
wires or dead trees, while scanning the fields
and fence rows for prey. Dressed in colorful
plumage with spotted breast, slate-blue wings,
red-brown back and tail, with head showing 2
black lines and a dot, he easily is seen and
readily identified. The female is slightly larger,
shows more banding on the tail and lacks the
blue wings, hers being browner.</p>
<p>These birds nest in holes in trees or around
buildings and join the Kingbirds, Chimney
Swifts and Martins in chasing other predators
out of the neighborhood. Their rapid swallow-like
flight makes them a mean contender in
any aerial joust.</p>
<p>The Sparrow Hawk ranges as far north as
Southern Canada and winters from the central
states south into South America.</p>

<h3 id="c9">Prairie Chicken
<br /><i>Tympanuchus cupido</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="468" height="452" />
</div>
<p>Those who live near prairies and brushy
grasslands have a chance to become acquainted
with this brown hen-like bird which formerly
ranged over much of the middle west. Cultivation
and hunters have reduced the numbers until
they no longer are common. The large size,
the short, dark, rounded tail, the heavily barred
underparts, the rounded wings, all are descriptive
of this bird. In flight he reminds you of
king-size Meadow Larks, flapping then sailing,
as he journeys to and from favorite feeding
grounds.</p>
<p>In early spring these birds gather in a selected
location known as a &ldquo;booming ground&rdquo;;
there the males defend a certain area against
other males, yet welcome the hens by strutting,
inflating their yellow throat sacks and erecting
the feathers over their heads until they resemble
ears. These antics are accompanied by clucks
and a series of 3-noted hoots which make up
their love songs. The males often engage in
fighting to protect their area.</p>
<p>Their food includes insects such as crickets,
grasshoppers and beetles with plenty of roughage
such as leaves, seeds and berries. Waste
corn, wheat, rye or sorghums are relished in
season. Heavy snows drive the birds to sumacs
and elm buds.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We hear your call in early morn</p>

<br /><i>Fulica americana</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="364" height="567" />
</div>
<p>This slate-gray bird with white bill and white
patch under the tail, belongs to the rail family
but spends more time with ducks. He swims
with a jerky motion of the head, dives like a
grebe, walks out on the shore and eats grass like
a goose. Yes, the &ldquo;mudhen,&rdquo; for that is what he
is commonly called, is quite versatile. When taking
flight, he either runs into the breeze or skitters
across the water for a short distance until
he can gain sufficient speed to gain altitude,
then away to safety.</p>
<p>Coots feed largely on underwater vegetation
and prefer algae or musk grass. Small fish or
other aquatic animals are eaten on occasion
while grass, grain or weeds are not overlooked.
When diving for food, these birds often are
robbed by the American Widgeon, or Baldpate,
which relishes such juicy morsels but does not
dive. Coots take such invasions as a matter of
course.</p>
<p>They build nests of dried leaves of marsh
plants, usually on a floating structure, either
well hidden or rather open, depending on the
habitat available.</p>
<p>Coots have large, greenish feet, with long-lobed
toes, not webbed like ducks or geese, but
just as useful for walking or swimming.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He feels at home</p>

<h3 id="c11">Killdeer
<br /><i>Charadrius vociferus</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="464" height="533" />
</div>
<p>The killdeer is the common plover which we
see in pastures, meadows, fields or on shores of
ponds and lakes. Freshly mown alfalfa fields,
short grass or stubble, even newly plowed fields
attract them. They gather in loose flocks to feed
on exposed insects or worms. Their usual pace
consists of a short run, a quick stop to check for
some juicy morsel, then another short run. All
stops are accompanied by a jerky movement as
if undecided whether to spring into the air or
stay on the ground. Even the spindly legged
young have this bobbing habit.</p>
<p>This bird is only a little bigger than the Robin,
but longer legs and tail make him appear larger.
White collar with 2 black bands across the
lower neck and upper breast, chestnut back and
tail, white lines in the wings in flight, all make
this plover easily identified. If there is any doubt
you will soon hear his &ldquo;kill-dee,&rdquo; or &ldquo;kill-deer&rdquo;
notes, for he is a noisy bird, quick to resent any
intrusion in his territory. These calls alert other
birds, much to the disgust of duck hunters who
are trying to make a quiet approach to their
blinds.</p>
<p>Nests are placed in open spots on the ground
and lined with pebbles or grasses. Eggs are
protectively colored and not easily found.</p>
<div class="verse">

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="401" height="418" />
</div>
<p>Any pond, lake or stream will be visited
sooner or later by these little sandpipers. You
find them teetering along shores, picking up
insects and small crustacea which form the
diet. Mud banks, sandy shores, pebbly mountain
streams, half-sunken logs, all furnish happy
hunting grounds.</p>
<p>The teetering tail is distinctive and no other
sandpiper has the round black spots on his
breast and none has the fluttering flight. They
seem to tip-toe thru the air with very short
wingbeats. Young and adults in winter plumage
do not show the spots but continue to teeter.
They often show a white spot just above the
bend of the wing when in this plumage. Their
usual note is a 2-tone &ldquo;peet-weet,&rdquo; which it
utters when flushed from its feeding ground.</p>
<p>These birds nest in a variety of places, sometimes
well hidden but often in more open situations
but always in a slight depression in the
ground. Their 4 eggs are protectively colored
and are sometimes found some distance from
water. The young teeter to the closest stream,
led by the ever-watchful mother. There you will
find them busily engaged in gathering food.
They can swim or even dive, if necessary.</p>

<br /><i>Chlidonias niger</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="354" height="595" />
</div>
<p>This tern is distinctive, especially in summer
plumage when the black head and body, short,
slightly notched tail, slate-gray wings, combined
with the erratic flight, tells us it has to
be a Black Tern. In winter plumage these birds
have white heads and bodies with backs and
wings darker than other terns. They show dark
spots around the eyes and back of neck. In fall
migration you find birds of this species in various
stages of dress, but there are usually a few
which carry enough black to give a clue to their
identity.</p>
<p>They nest in inland marshes and around lakes,
forming loose colonies on favorite nesting sites.
Floating vegetation, muskrat houses, in fact
most any structure strong enough to support a
nest is used.</p>
<p>Black Terns feed on larger insects such as
moths, grasshoppers, dragonflies and water insects
which they obtain from the air or by gliding
down and picking them from the water.
They can be seen flying over the fields like
swallows or nighthawks, feeding as they go.
When flying over lakes, they often hover then
glide to the surface for minnows or insects.</p>
<p>These terns spend the winter in South America
and migrate earlier than some species. They
also arrive later from their winter homes.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="403" height="499" />
</div>
<p>There is something about a dove which makes
you want to know him better. Could it be his
low mournful call? (And why do we call it
mournful? Someone described it in that manner,
and while it is not as colorful as other bird
notes, it has a restful and pleasing quality.)
Could it be the graceful flight which shows the
pointed tail with the white trimming? Could it
be dainty steps which seem to fit his personality?
Perhaps the way he drinks by inserting his
bill and swallowing water until he has his fill.
It might be the way he builds his nest: no time
wasted when this bird constructs a home. It
might even be the way he jerks his head, as if
trying to get a better focus on the sights of the
world.</p>
<p>Some call him brown; if so, where did we get
the description, &ldquo;dove colored&rdquo;? In good light,
the head and neck have a rich sheen which
blends with the rest of the body. All in all, he
is a beautiful bird.</p>
<p>He nests in almost any spot which suits
his fancy, on the ground, in evergreens, around
buildings, well out on a limb or in the crotch of
a tree, but always in a loosely constructed home,
unless he takes over some well constructed
nest, made by others.</p>
<p>His food consists mostly of weed seeds.</p>

<br /><i>Coccyzus americanus</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="418" height="577" />
</div>
<p>This slim, long-tailed bird is far more common
than people suspect for he seldom is seen.
He prefers to move slowly thru the heavy foliage,
peering under each branch and leaf for
the leaf-eating worms which form his diet.
Wooly worms, which other birds seem to shun,
are relished by him. His long bill is a perfect
tool for breaking into webs where he creates
havoc with the wiggly inhabitants.</p>
<p>Cuckoos are larger than Robins and their long
tails make them look even longer than the 12&frac14;
inches which they measure. They fly directly
from the center of one tree to the next, thus
giving us a chance to check the rufous coloring
of the wings and the large white spots on the
ends of their black tails. The back is dark gray
while the breast and belly are white. The yellow
lower bill, the rufous wings and larger white
spots on the tail are the main difference between
this and the slightly smaller Black-billed
Cuckoo. Both have a series of clucking notes
but the Yellow-billed Cuckoo song gets slower,
then runs down the scale, different from his
relative&rsquo;s long efforts.</p>
<p>Unlike the Old-World cuckoos which depend
on other birds to rear their young, the Yellow-billed
builds a nest, altho it is flimsy. There, the
3 or 4 young get their start in life.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="312" height="608" />
</div>
<p>The Screech Owl is the smallest of the eared
owls, about robin size. In fact he often nests
in holes built by larger woodpeckers such as
flickers. Like other owls, he hunts at night when
his quavering call blends with the murmur of
the night breeze. Mice, shrews, beetles, moths,
crayfish, frogs and small birds seem to furnish
a well-rounded diet.</p>
<p>These small owls have 2 distinct color phases,
one a rich brown, the other a soft gray. Both
blend with the bark of trees thus giving them
protection. This is one of the mysteries of the
bird world. Just why do these owls wear different
colors? Both colors are often found in the
same brood.</p>
<p>Even tho small, they give a good account of
themselves and soon let you know when they
have young in the vicinity. The parents defend
their young against all comers and often surprise
innocent persons who may stroll too close
to the young only to be attacked by the irate
parents.</p>
<p>This bird prefers open woodlands, orchards
and clearings and often spends the day in the
same cavities which are used for nesting. Some
even spend the day in evergreens, but soon
attract the attention of other birds which hate
all owls and soon make their feelings known.</p>

</div>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a hawk, but like other members of
the Goatsucker family, often feeds at night. This
gray-brown, robin size bird with white bars
across the wings, often is called a &ldquo;bull-bat.&rdquo;
Early morning and late evenings seem to be
favorite feeding times for then insects on which
he feeds, are on the wing. During the day you
will find him sitting horizontally on some sheltered
limb, his colors blending perfectly. He
looks more like a knot or broken stub than a
bird. He leaves his resting place with a glide
and then goes into his distinctive flight.</p>
<p>The Nighthawk often ascends high in the sky
with a series of quick wing beats, each accompanied
by his call of a nasal &ldquo;peent.&rdquo; When the
desired height is attained, he folds his wings
slightly and dives with a booming sound. This
is a part of the breeding display.</p>
<p>Nests are no problem, for this bird prefers
a graveled flat roof or some similar open space
where a slight depression furnishes ample protection
for the eggs. The mother shelters her
eggs and young from the blistering sun which
beats down.</p>

<h3 id="c18">Chimney Swift
<br /><i>Chaetura pelagica</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="421" height="577" />
</div>
<p>Unlike swallows which bend their wings, this
bird holds his wings straight, but the natural
curve gives the appearance of a bow. The long
wings make him appear larger than the small
sparrow size which he attains. This sooty-black
swift is the only member of his family which
visits the eastern part of America and since he
has adopted chimneys as his favorite nesting
and roosting sites, he is not hard to find.</p>
<p>Few birds seem so perfectly fitted for living
in the air and except when nesting or roosting,
there is where he will be found. When flying,
he looks almost like a bird without head or tail
but if you will examine him closely you will find
a short tail with spines which combined with
his sharp claws, help anchor him to the flat inner
surface of chimneys. Nests consist of small
twigs which he snaps off the end of some dead
limb while flying by, then glues to the chimney
with saliva. This does not make an imposing
structure, but is ample for safety of eggs and
young.</p>
<p>The swift is a fast flier and combines long
circular glides with quick wing beats and sharp
turns, this erratic flight accompanied by a series
of sharp, clicking notes which aids in identification.
While drinking or bathing each bird glides
down, each hitting the water in turn.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Cigar with wings,&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="c19">Ruby-throated Hummingbird
<br /><i>Archilochus colubris</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="449" height="394" />
</div>
<p>This, the smallest bird found in the area, can
be confused only with large moths such as the
sphinx or hawk moths. Both the moths and
hummingbirds like to feed on deep-throated
flowers such as honeysuckles, petunias and
trumpet-vines but the moths prefer late evening
or early morning while the hummer never
passes up a chance to explore such flowers with
his long brush-like tongue with which he gathers
nectar. This combined with small insects
and spiders goes to make up his diet. Brightly
colored phials filled with sugar water will attract
him to your yard.</p>
<p>Hummingbirds are among the best fliers of
the bird world and can hover, fly backward or
forward or straight away, whatever meets their
fancy. The male has a green back and in some
lights the throat patch looks black only to flash
ruby red when the bird changes position so the
light is reflected. The female is duller and has
white feather tips on the tail.</p>
<p>The female builds one of the daintiest of nests
on top of some sloping branch, using lichens and
spider web to attach the cup to the limb. This
little nest which is only 1&frac12; inches in diameter
is not often found for it has the appearance of
being only a part of the branch. Two young constitute
the usual family.</p>
<div class="verse">

<br /><i>Megaceryle alcyon</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="434" height="438" />
</div>
<p>Rarely in the bird world, is the female more
colorful than the male. The Belted Kingfisher
is one example, for the female sports brown
flanks and breastband in addition to the blue-gray
belt worn by her mate. These birds, larger
than Robins, can be confused only with the Blue
Jay; however, their plumage is blue-gray. Near
creeks, ponds, lakes or other bodies of water
they may be seen flying low over the water or
hovering momentarily before plunging after
some minnow, crayfish or other food which has
attracted their attention. They have choice
perches over the water and fly from one spot to
another, always on the lookout for unwary prey.
They are rather solitary in habits, each pair
defending its territory against all comers.</p>
<p>The large head and beak, uneven crest, habit
of flapping and sailing, the series of call notes
often referred to as a rattle, are distinctly kingfisher.
Nesting holes are dug in steep banks and
extend several feet before ending in an enlarged
space which holds the eggs and young. Both
birds help with the digging using their strong
bills to loosen the dirt and their flatly constructed
feet to kick it out.</p>
<p>Kingfishers eat small fry which abound in
such numbers that a natural check is desirable.</p>
<div class="verse">

<br /><i>Dendrocopos pubescens</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="299" height="488" />
</div>
<p>The sparrow-size Downy Woodpecker resembles
his robin-size cousin, the Hairy Woodpecker,
but his notes are a little softer and his
tapping a little faster for his short bill can produce
no such wallop as the heavy-billed Hairy.
The outer tail feathers are barred, instead of
the black and white pattern of the latter. Both
males show a red spot on the nape which is lacking
on the females. General coloring is black
and white.</p>
<p>While this friendly little woodpecker relishes
suet, he does not let his visits to your feeder
interfere with his constant search for the larvae
which he finds in galls, cornstalks, weed stems
or the bark of trees. He makes a small opening
into the tunnel where the larvae are hiding,
then inserts his long tongue and spears the
worm. Nature has provided him with a barbed
spear on his long tongue and he uses it constantly
in protecting our trees.</p>
<p>Spring brings much activity for a nesting
site must be found, then the labor of digging a
cavity from 8 to 12 inches deep in a post, dead
limb or tree trunk. The home may be near the
ground or high in some tree and often is found
with the entrance beneath a limb. There the
young are protected until they can join their
parents in their search for insects.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It seems absurd for such a bird</p>
<p class="t0">To work so hard, we know</p>
<p class="t0">But every worm must learn to turn</p>

<h3 id="c22">Eastern Kingbird
<br /><i>Tyrannus tyrannus</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="394" height="615" />
</div>
<p>The Eastern Kingbird, altho slightly smaller
than a Robin, is &ldquo;monarch of all he surveys,&rdquo;
and is ready and willing to defend his territory
against all comers. His happiest moments seem
to be spent in chasing hawks, crows, herons or
vultures and he is the first to see their approach
and give the alarm. Then, like a fighter-plane,
he speeds high in the air and dives on the intruder.
Such aerial attacks are of short duration
for the larger bird soon escapes to a safer
location. He then drops back to his favorite
perch, often using such quick wing-beats that
he seems to be tip-toeing thru the air.</p>
<p>This flycatcher with his white breast, dark
head, back and wings, and black tail with white
terminal band, is identified easily. He likes to
nest around farm homes or other open country
but wants a few open spots where he can perch
while waiting for passing insects. People who
raise bees often refer to him as a &ldquo;bee-martin,&rdquo;
and accuse him of eating honeybees. There is
little ground for this accusation for only 22
stomachs of 634 examined showed a total of 61
bees eaten and 51 of the total were drones. On
the other hand, this bird eats robber flies which
catch and destroy bees. Eighty-five per cent
of his food consists of insects which includes
grasshoppers, crickets and cutworms.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He tiptoes thru the ozone</p>
<p class="t0">Demure in black and white,</p>
<p class="t0">Let other birds take warning</p>

<h3 id="c23">Eastern Phoebe
<br /><i>Sayornis phoebe</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="413" height="571" />
</div>
<p>Unlike many of the flycatchers, this bird
which is only a little larger than the English
Sparrow, is easily identified. His black bill, lack
of wing bars or eye ring is distinctive but his
habit of jerking or waving his tail is conclusive.
The habit of repeating his name over and over
in a low but emphatic tone gives little doubt of
his presence. Some people might confuse this
call with the high notes of the Black-capped
Chickadee but when once learned there is little
resemblance.</p>
<p>The Phoebe is one of the hardiest of his clan,
often wintering in the southern portion of its
nesting range and returning in spring so early
that we often wonder how he can find sufficient
flying insects to sustain life.</p>
<p>The Phoebe likes to place his well-built nest
under some sort of a shelter. Any overhanging
cliff, under bridges, even rafters or window sills
are not overlooked as long as some projecting
surface furnishes a place to start the foundation.
Mud and moss are the main materials used
for building and this bird knows that such a
nest will not stand too much rough weather.</p>
<p>Two broods usually are raised during the
summer and it takes a lot of small flying insects
to keep these healthy youngsters happy, so you
are lucky if he decides to be your neighbor.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Neath bridges or on sheltered walls</p>

<br /><i>Eremophila alpestris</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="437" height="457" />
</div>
<p>A sparrow-size bird with black tail, which
flushes from the road while you travel along,
is the Horned Lark. When you travel slower
you will find that he walks when he moves
around, never hopping like birds which prefer
trees. Other marks to look for are a black
crown, black line extending from the beak,
curving back and down over the cheek and a
black patch below the white or yellow throat.
A white or yellow line, depending on the subspecies
of the bird you see, separates the crown
from the black facial pattern. The horns, from
which the bird gets his name, consist of 2 tufts
of feathers extending up from the crown, but
sometimes are hard to see. Body color is brownish
above with light belly.</p>
<p>Horned Larks prefer short-grass country with
barren hills or other open spots such as the
sandy shoulders of highways. There you will
find them walking or running in their search
for small seeds or insects. When snow covers
the ground they flock to the highways where
graders and snowplows have removed the icy
covering.</p>
<p>This, our only true lark, nests early in spring
when late snows make life hazardous. Then you
will hear his twittering call as it floats in on the
chilly breeze.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">On barren ground or highway</p>
<p class="t0">He walks with dainty step,</p>
<p class="t0">He dines on seeds and insects</p>

<h3 id="c25">Barn Swallow
<br /><i>Hirundo rustica</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="414" height="534" />
</div>
<p>This friendly bird discovered long ago that
barns or sheds made excellent cover for its
adobe nest and now you often will find from one
to several of these mud structures neatly plastered
on the beams of buildings. This is a happy
arrangement for both the tenant and landlord,
for the swallow more than pays the rent on the
space used, not in cash but in the thousands of
insects which make up his food. The swallow
gets whatever protection is offered.</p>
<p>A Barn Swallow is identified easily. No other
swallow has the steel-blue back, the brown
spot above the bill with brown throat and belly
nor the deeply forked tail showing white beneath.
Another good field mark is the way he
flies with wings bent so the long pointed primaries
point back. He is a swift but erratic flier
and it is a pleasure to watch him as he darts
across a field, pond or pasture, searching for
flying insects.</p>
<p>His song is a series of twittering notes, rather
musical and when once learned will be easily
remembered. Many of the notes have a liquid
or bubbling sound which is distinctive.</p>
<p>Two broods of 4 or 5 young usually are raised
during the summer. Fall brings huge but loose
flocks, headed south and feeding as they go, all
headed for South America for the winter.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="426" height="517" />
</div>
<p>This, the largest member of the swallow family,
has adopted the many-roomed apartments
which man is glad to furnish. For there are few
people who do not take pleasure in watching
the graceful flight of this bird as he flaps and
sails above your trees. His low-pitched, gurgling
notes help to identify him.</p>
<p>They arrive from their winter homes rather
early in spring and often are heard or seen by
the latter part of March. Heavy mortality can
result when late snows or icy rains cut down
the quota of flying insects which are his food.
As soon as family cares are over, they gather
in huge flocks and soon leave for their winter
home in South America. They usually are gone
by the last of August.</p>
<p>The male is entirely blue-black which may
look purple in some lights, while the female and
young birds show lighter breasts with duller
head and back.</p>
<p>A Purple Martin is a social bird and likes to
nest in colonies. A series of gourds, boxes or
a fancy many-roomed martin house all seem
to offer an equal appeal to this bird; however,
he prefers they be placed on a pole well above
the ground and in an open space where he can
come and go without dodging limbs. A pond or
lake in the neighborhood is desirable.</p>
<div class="verse">

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="444" height="368" />
</div>
<p>You may admire him greatly or hate him intensely.
It depends on what he is doing when
you form your opinion. A flock of these blue
and white birds with large crests and black
chin-straps, add color and cheer as they pass
thru the timber. They often are conversing in
a series of soft musical tones which are pleasing
to the ear when all is serene. Moments later
they discover a sleeping owl, cat or snake and
the flock changes into a group of loud-mouthed
bullies. Such is the way of a Blue Jay.</p>
<p>During the nesting season, this bird which is
larger than a Robin, shows the darker side of
his character, for then he destroys the homes
of many nesting birds, eating both eggs and
young of the smaller species. You can hate him
and all of his kin for such habits, but this is
nature and nature is never mild. Later you will
find him hiding pecans, acorns or sunflower
seeds under leaves, sticks or moss. Then you
will learn that he does a lot of good, for many
of these seeds are never eaten but grow into
new trees or bushes. It is just as natural for
Blue Jays to hide these acorns as it is for squirrels
to do the same thing. His alarm notes often
save animals and birds for they have learned
to heed his warning call.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He dresses like a dandy</p>

<br /><i>Corvus brachyrhynchos</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="480" height="448" />
</div>
<p>In many areas there is no other with which
this 19-inch all-black bird could be confused.
His steady wing beat, his characteristic call of
&ldquo;caw&rdquo; or &ldquo;ca-ah,&rdquo; his flocking habits in fall and
winter help to identify him. Along the Atlantic
and Gulf shores, the smaller Fish Crow is found,
while on the western prairies the White-necked
Raven which is slightly larger, may be confused
with the Crow. Mountainous areas and seacoasts
also have the Common Raven, which is
much larger, but all show the color pattern of
the Common Crow. The last 3 birds have different
calls and all are more inclined to mix a lot
of sailing in their flight.</p>
<p>But what about the crow? We know he robs
nests of eggs and young, we know that he eats
corn, peanuts, pecans, in fact anything he can
lay his beak on, and he is cunning enough to
get his share. But do we give him credit for the
huge crop of grasshoppers, crickets, moths and
weed seeds he consumes? We may be blaming
him unduly, for many of his food habits are
beneficial.</p>
<p>In winter they gather in huge roosting flocks
and can be seen going to and from these roosts.
They co-operate with each other both in finding
food and seeking protection. Their system must
be admired for they are doing all right.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We feel quite sure</p>
<p class="t0">That you all know</p>

<br /><i>Parus atricapillus</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="337" height="622" />
</div>
<p>Altho smaller than a sparrow, this little bird
is hardy. He does not leave his summer home
and move to a warmer climate just to dodge
the snow and sleet. You will find him feeding
just as happily in a snowstorm as on a warm
spring day, always consuming small insects,
their eggs or larvae. Exploring the trunks of
trees, hanging upside down on the end of a
limb, or hunting larvae on tender leaves, it
makes no difference to this sharp-eyed bird.
Those of you who feed birds will find the chickadee
one of your friendliest customers, for he
relishes peanut butter, suet, sunflower seeds or
doughnuts and often gets tame enough to eat
from your hand.</p>
<p>He shows a whitish line on the edge of his
wing which is lacking on the slightly smaller
Carolina Chickadee which has a southern range.
The latter bird uses a 4-note call &ldquo;fe-be-fe-bay,&rdquo;
while the black-capped uses only &ldquo;phe-be.&rdquo; The
normal chick-a-de-de-de call of the black-capped
seems a little lower and slower than that of his
southern cousin.</p>
<p>Both birds nest in cavities in stumps or trees,
some being old nesting sites of the Downy
Woodpecker, while others are prepared by the
chickadees themselves. This seems quite a task
for so small a bird.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="388" height="470" />
</div>
<p>This sparrow-size cousin of the chickadee has
a tuft of feathers which gives him a striking
appearance. The tuft, nape, back, wings and
tail are slate gray, while the cheek, throat,
breast and belly are white with a pinkish-brown
patch just below the wing. Habits are similar
to chickadees and he often can be found feeding
in loose flocks with these and other small birds
such as Downy Woodpeckers, nuthatches and
Brown Creepers. Together they form a useful
team for what one species misses by his method
of feeding, one of the others will find by a
slightly different method.</p>
<p>They nest in holes in trees or even a bird box
to their liking. They are noisy birds and their
song is much louder and clearer than you would
expect to hear from such small singers. The
song consists of a series of whistled notes which
sound like &ldquo;pet-er&rdquo; or &ldquo;pet-o,&rdquo; the first note usually
slightly higher. Other notes remind you of
a Carolina Wren or a Kentucky Warbler but the
phrasing and tempo soon lead you to proper
identification.</p>
<p>A titmouse enjoys a well-stocked feeder and
is a nice neighbor for he enjoys singing and the
clear whistled notes add a touch of nature to a
cold winter day.</p>
<div class="verse">

<img src="images/p08d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="433" height="532" />
</div>
<p>There is no other bird quite like the Brown
Creeper. He is well named for his brown plumage
with lighter stripes gives him perfect protection
as he climbs spirally up some rough-barked
tree. His curved bill, sharp claws and
long tail, all serve a distinct purpose in helping
him find his food. Hackberries or other rough-barked
trees serve as his hunting grounds and
there you will find him checking the cracks and
crevices as he starts from the base and works
upward, sometimes checking the larger limbs,
but often dropping down to the base of the next
tree after reaching the lower limbs. Insects,
their eggs and larvae form the major portion of
his diet but he will not spurn suet on your feeder.</p>
<p>Brown Creepers are found in this area only in
winter, when they can be found in loose flocks
along with kinglets, chickadees, nuthatches,
Downy Woodpeckers and titmice, all working
together to rid the trees of the insects which are
wintering there.</p>
<p>His note is a weak lisp which can be confused
only with the series of similar notes uttered by
the Golden-crowned Kinglet. He nests under a
strip of loose bark or occasionally in knotholes
or well-hidden spots around larger trees.</p>

<p>Most Americans seem to have fallen in love
with the House Wren. It could not be his beauty
for he lacks the distinctive markings found on
other birds, even other wrens. Even in good light
you see only a small grayish-brown bird with
lighter underparts. It is surely not his size for
he is smaller than a sparrow. His song is a sort
of spontaneous outburst of notes which give
you more quantity than quality, with a liberal
helping of scolding notes, so it is not his vocal
efforts. He is not a good bird neighbor for he
often punctures the eggs of other nesting birds
in his area. It must be his independence that has
won him favor.</p>
<p>No other bird finds such an assortment of
nesting boxes, all sizes, shapes and colors, some
homemade, others purchased. Some he will use,
while others offer no attraction. He may pass up
a well-placed wren house to build in the pocket
of an old coat hung in a shed. He likes boxes 8 to
10 feet above ground, not hidden by limbs.</p>
<p>He prefers low shrubs, piles of brush or wood,
or even open spots in heavy timber, for there he
finds the insects and small spiders which form
the major part of his food. Most of his hunting
is either on or near the ground while nesting
sites are seldom above 12 feet. He runs to large
families and more than one brood is reared.</p>

<br /><i>Mimus polyglottos</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="375" height="564" />
</div>
<p>A trim, robin-size pale gray bird which shows
extensive white patches on the wings and outer
tail when in flight. These markings will identify
this bird in winter when you find him feeding on
whatever fruits or berries he can locate. He does
not choose to migrate when a good supply of red
cedar, bush honeysuckle, multiflora rose, persimmon,
bittersweet or other such seeds are
available. Raisins or currants will entice him to
your feeder but he is too big a bully to make a
good guest for he chases other birds away.</p>
<p>In summer he adds other little habits which
soon bring him to your attention. First, his
song, a medley of rich notes which include not
only his own song, but a mimicked version
of other songs and sounds which he has heard.
These are usually repeated 2 or 3 times and then
he goes to a new series, which may be harsh or
pleasing. His song has more variety of notes
than the Brown Thrasher or Catbird. He prefers
high perches when singing, such as aerials,
chimneys, windmills, trees, buildings or water
towers. He always is doing unusual things like
leaping into the air or going thru other antics
which show his well-marked plumage.</p>
<p>He likes to nest in arbors, shrubs or trees
which offer protection to his bulky home which
is often only a few feet above the ground.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="268" height="511" />
</div>
<p>This trim member of the mocker family leaves
no doubt as to his identity. No other bird has a
uniform slate-gray plumage with a black cap
and rusty brown under-tail coverts. It makes
little difference if you miss the rusty marking
under the tail, or even see the bird, for he soon
discloses his identity by his song. The normal
song consists of a series of musical phrases, well
seasoned with catlike mews, often heard coming
from some concealed perch in shrubs or low
bushes, for there is the favorite home of the
catbird.</p>
<p>Altho slightly smaller than a Robin, he consumes
many insects while waiting for the small
fruit and berries to ripen. Mulberries and wild
cherries are relished in season, while strawberries,
blackberries or grapes are not overlooked.</p>
<p>He prefers low shrubbery or vines for nesting
and builds rather a bulky structure of sticks,
twigs, paper, rags or leaves, lined with finer material.
Two broods during the summer keep the
parents busily engaged.</p>
<p>When trying to impress his mate, he often
fluffs his feathers out until he looks much larger,
sticks his head up with mouth open and struts
around like a clown. It is just a part of nature.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In brushy thickets or some low tree</p>

<h3 id="c35">Robin
<br /><i>Turdus migratorius</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="432" height="459" />
</div>
<p>There is no reason to tell you this bird is robin-size
except that we would like you to remember
he is 10 inches long. This helps when making a
comparison with other birds. This medium-size
member of the thrush family makes himself at
home on your lawn, in your garden, pastures or
fields. There you will see his reddish breast,
dark head and back, all distinctive in sunlight
or shadow. Yes, you can spot a Robin anywhere.
The young have spotted breasts which is typical
of the thrush family.</p>
<p>Robins are early risers and start singing as
soon as the first faint glow shows the approach
of a new day. Robins do most of their feeding
on the ground. There you will see them making
a short run, then stop, look and listen. They
seem to be able to hear their prey, for you will
notice them digging worms and insects from
depths which would make them impossible to
see. These birds sometimes add small snakes,
minnows or frogs to their diet of worms, insects
and fruit. Hackberries, persimmons and
red cedar seeds help carry them thru the winter.</p>
<p>Robins often winter rather far north and are
one of the first migrants to make an appearance
in spring.</p>

<h3 id="c36">Eastern Bluebird
<br /><i>Sialia sialis</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="394" height="480" />
</div>
<p>This small thrush, only slightly larger than an
English Sparrow, is held in high esteem by those
who have made his acquaintance. Unlike the
Hermit and Wood Thrushes which sing in the
seclusion of deep forests, the Bluebird prefers
open country with scattered trees. Old apple orchards
make choice locations for usually they
have a number of old woodpecker holes for
nests.</p>
<p>Unlike most thrushes, he is not noted for his
song, however his frequently heard &ldquo;tur-wee,&rdquo;
gives a restful assurance that all is well. The
male has bright blue upper parts with reddish-brown
breast. The female is duller with only the
wings and tail showing blue with duller brown
breast. The young have spotted breasts like
others of the thrush family.</p>
<p>Bluebird houses will help bring this bird to
your community but remember that the opening
should be smaller than 1&frac12; inches which will
admit Starlings, while low sites such as fence
posts discourage the English Sparrow. These
birds cover a large area in their search for food
so houses should be spaced accordingly.</p>
<p>Grasshoppers, crickets, cutworms and other
insects form a major portion of the food while
small fruits and berries also are relished. Like
the Robin, he often spends his winters with us.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A little bit of heaven</p>

<h3 id="c37">Golden-crowned Kinglet
<br /><i>Regulus satrapa</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="379" height="418" />
</div>
<p>Energetic little birds, smaller than House
Wrens, the Golden-crowned Kinglets spend the
winter busily engaged in searching the twigs
and branches for insect eggs or larvae. There
they join mixed flocks of chickadees, Brown
Creepers, nuthatches and Downy Woodpeckers,
all working together to protect our trees. He is
easily identified for he has the habit of flicking
his wings as he moves thru the branches. His
short, slightly forked tail, white line over the
eye, distinct wing bars, all seem dull when compared
to the golden crown, edged with black.
This gives an artistic touch to his olive-gray
plumage. The female shows a yellowish crown.
The only bird with which he can be confused is
the Ruby-crowned Kinglet which shows a distinct
eye ring. He flashes his ruby crown only
when excited.</p>
<p>Like the Brown Creeper, this bird has a faint
lisping call which usually is given in a series of
from one to 3 notes, not the single note of the
creeper.</p>
<p>They often feed in low bushes or shrubs,
sometimes on the ground and seem to have little
fear of man and will permit a close inspection.
When feeding high in the trees, their small
size gives you a clue to their identity.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh, little king with crown of gold</p>
<p class="t0">How do you stand the winter&rsquo;s cold?</p>

<h3 id="c38">Loggerhead Shrike
<br /><i>Lanius ludovicianus</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="420" height="428" />
</div>
<p>A gray bird with a black mask over the eyes,
black wings which show a white patch when
flying, and a black tail with white margins, all
help identify this shrike. His head seems large
when compared to his trim body, he has a
hooked beak, the under plumage is white. If
there is any doubt, watch him fly from one perch
to another. He drops down near the ground,
flies rapidly and then zooms up to his next location.
Another habit is flicking his tail like a
Phoebe when he alights.</p>
<p>This bird likes open fields, pastures, grassy or
weedy grounds with handy perches where he
can get a good view of his surroundings. He has
good eyes and any small snake, mouse or grasshopper
will cause him to investigate. He often
hovers before striking and catches his prey with
his strong beak, for his feet are not equipped
with heavy claws like most predators. This also
makes it necessary for him to impale his prey
on thorns, barbed wire or some other pointed
object where he can cut it with his sharp bill.</p>
<p>Shrikes seem to prefer thorny trees for nesting,
but will use whatever is available. Most
nests are rather low and are bulky structures.</p>
<p>These birds kill more food than they consume
and would be held in better repute except for
the habit of killing other birds.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A &ldquo;butcher-bird,&rdquo; you hear folks say</p>
<p class="t0">For you use thorns to hang your prey.</p>
<p class="t0">Now we don&rsquo;t mind, your catching mice,</p>
<p class="t0">But killing songbirds isn&rsquo;t nice.</p>

<h3 id="c39">Starling
<br /><i>Sturnus vulgaris</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="456" height="473" />
</div>
<p>Previous to 1890, this bird was unknown in
America. Then a few pairs were released in New
York City and now look at them! Starlings are
everywhere. When walking around your yard
or field he appears to be black with a short tail,
pointed wings and a sharp pointed beak which
is yellow in summer and brownish-black in winter.
On closer inspection you will find that he
is a little smaller than a Robin, greenish with
speckled plumage in fall and winter, which develops
into greenish-purple in spring. In flight
he flaps and sails much like a Meadowlark but
his short tail and wing pattern are distinctive.
The young are brownish with lighter throats.</p>
<p>Many of the Starling&rsquo;s feeding habits are
beneficial for he eats many worms and insects
which he finds by turning over leaves or probing
with his sharp bill. The fact that he likes fruit
on occasion is not in his favor for he likes to
travel in flocks and it takes a lot of fruit to feed
a flock of Starlings.</p>
<p>Starlings have not learned to migrate and
large flocks often gather about buildings to
roost, and what noisy, dirty lodgers they are.
Perhaps the worst habit is that of taking over
all the available nesting sites before our native
birds arrive in spring. Every hole, crack or
cranny is occupied, so where are they to go?</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When foreigners invade our land</p>
<p class="t0">They sometimes get clear out of hand.</p>
<p class="t0">So leave them all where they belong</p>

<h3 id="c40">Red-eyed Vireo
<br /><i>Vireo olivaceus</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="406" height="440" />
</div>
<p>Unlike some of his relatives which prefer low
bushes and shrubs, the Red-eyed Vireo prefers
heavily-wooded areas. Where forests occur, he
is the commonest bird. Clearing of timber reduced
much of his habitat, but any grove of
trees will furnish a home for this species. His
numbers are limited only by the area of the
wooded section.</p>
<p>Vireos are more often heard than seen for
they feed slowly thru the tops of high trees, but
have an endless series of notes and sing during
the hot summer days when other birds seek
shelter. The song consists of a series of short
phrases sometimes rising, sometimes falling, as
if the bird were talking to himself, even answering
his own questions, with a distinct pause between.
Some of these notes have a robin or
tanager-like quality, but the repeated song soon
places the bird.</p>
<p>When you see this sparrow-size bird, you will
find that he has a clear white line over the eye,
bordered with black. This is his only outstanding
mark for he has no wing bars. His general
appearance is greenish-gray above, white below
with a greenish-yellow tinge on the sides
and flanks. His red eye is not distinct enough
to make a good field mark. His main diet consists
of leaf-eating worms.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">With others hushed</p>

<h3 id="c41">Myrtle Warbler
<br /><i>Dendroica coronata</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11a.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="429" height="449" />
</div>
<p>The Myrtle Warbler is a member of a colorful
family of American birds most of which are
smaller than sparrows, have thin pointed bills,
are more active than vireos. They are often referred
to as the butterflies of the bird world.
The Myrtle Warbler is presented because he is
the first to arrive in spring, often before the
leaves arrive to hide him from view. This 5&frac12;-inch
bird has 4 yellow marks which will identify
him: the crown, rump and each side of the
breast. He appears darker than most warblers,
being blue-gray above, white below with black
marks across the breast and back beneath the
wings. The white throat and 2 white wing bars
offer contrast. Females and young lack the brilliant
markings of the male, but the yellow rump
patch will identify the birds. The white throat
distinguishes this from other warblers which
show a yellow rump.</p>
<p>This bird is a migrant since he prefers to nest
in the evergreens of Northern United States
and Canada. He feeds on insects and larvae
which infest our trees but captures many flying
insects when available. Often he winters farther
north than you would expect to find warblers
and then feeds on small berries. Myrtle or bayberries
are a favorite food and the name of the
bird indicates its fondness for these berries.</p>
<div class="verse">

<br /><i>Geothlypis trichas</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="343" height="485" />
</div>
<p>The adult male of this species wears a black
mask over his eyes and is only 5&frac14; inches long.
The female lacks the mask but has a yellow
throat, white belly and olive-brown head, back,
wings and tail which identify the birds.</p>
<p>They nest over a wide area, favorite habitat
being bushy thickets near water. He is quick to
resent any invasion of his privacy and uses a
variety of scolding notes to let you know how
unhappy he is. His movements are wren-like
and hurried and his black eyes fairly sparkle to
show his excitement. He soon vanishes into the
undergrowth but you will have a chance to
learn his call which sounds like &ldquo;witchity, witchity,
witchity,&rdquo; or &ldquo;witcheree, witcheree, witcheree,&rdquo;
usually repeated 3 times.</p>
<p>While all warblers are beneficial, the Yellowthroat
perhaps leads the list for he feeds over
a large area and in a variety of places. Cankerworms
in your orchard will soon bring this bird
for they along with fall webworms, are his favorites.
Other caterpillars, plant lice, leaf-hoppers,
grasshoppers, flies and beetles add variety
to his menu and protection to the farmer.</p>
<p>They nest on or near the ground, the female
builds the nest and hatches the young, but he
is a devoted father and helps gather juicy worms
to feed the offspring.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A singing bandit he might be</p>
<p class="t0">Who seems to say just &ldquo;witchity.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>Passer domesticus</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="394" height="465" />
</div>
<p>Whether you call him an English Sparrow or
a House Sparrow, makes little difference. He is
not a sparrow, nor can we blame the English
for the vast population of these birds found
within our borders. The fact that it is a weaver-finch
would indicate that Africa was the original
home of this species. This bird has been introduced
into many countries and he soon adapts
himself to any surroundings. The record shows
that 8 pairs were introduced in Brooklyn in 1850
but did not survive. Two years later, more were
imported and now they are at home over a wide
range.</p>
<p>Since we have referred to this bird for comparative
size, it is well that we keep him in
mind. His length runs from 5&frac12; to 6&frac14; inches
with a wingspread of 9&frac12; to 10 inches. The male
is rather colorful with his gray crown, chestnut
nape, white cheeks, black throat and chest,
brown back and gray-white belly. The thick
finch-like bill, the slightly notched tail which
they flick often, the habit of hopping when feeding
on the ground&mdash;all help in identification.
The young and winter males resemble the female
which is a dull-brown above with gray-white
below and a pale stripe over the eye.</p>
<p>They consume quantities of insects but will
eat almost anything available.</p>
<div class="verse">

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p12.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="454" height="620" />
</div>
<p>This chunky robin-size bird is perfectly at
home in fields and pastures. There he is easily
recognized as a plump brown-streaked bird with
yellow underparts and a black crescent on the
breast like a black V. The short tail shows
white on each side and is flicked nervously. The
crown shows black and white stripes. They fly
low over the fields with a series of flaps and
sails and walk around short-grass meadows in
their search for insects.</p>
<p>They are not larks but are closely related to
Starlings, as shown by their scientific name and
their resemblance to the invading flocks of these
aliens. Unlike their relatives, Meadowlarks have
no bad habits and feed largely on cutworms,
grasshoppers and beetles which are found in
their chosen habitat.</p>
<p>The Eastern Meadowlark has a loud clear
song often referred to as &ldquo;spring is here,&rdquo; while
his western cousin, slightly smaller in size, produces
a series of whistled notes and warbles
which is quite pleasing to the ear. Both have a
series of chattering notes which is typical. Neither
is hesitant about singing and they add much
to their surroundings by the quality of song.</p>
<p>They not only should be protected but encouraged
to nest around farms for they more
than pay their way.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p12b.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="423" height="410" />
</div>
<p>A black bird with a bright red shoulder patch
identifies the adult male. Females and young are
a heavily streaked gray-brown while young
males are brown with an orange wing patch. In
fall and winter the brilliant red shoulder patch
is not so apparent, sometimes reduced to only a
line.</p>
<p>These numerous birds are slightly smaller
than Robins and are abundant along ditches,
ponds, lakes or other marshy areas where they
nest in rushes, cattails or small bushes surrounding
water. Irrigation has increased their
habitat until they are one of our common birds.
Vast flocks spend the winter in southern
marshes.</p>
<p>While nesting in swamps or other low areas,
they range widely in search of insects and larvae
and account for many which would be injurious
to crops. In fall they feed heavily on weed seeds
and waste grain. Huge flocks are not welcomed
in the unharvested rice fields of the south.</p>
<p>Feeding habits make him a good neighbor to
everyone in his northern range before he joins
the flocks of Starlings and other birds which
flock to the southern areas.</p>

marsh.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p12c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="354" height="501" />
</div>
<p>The coffee-brown head and black body of the
male are distinctive, but in fall the brown head
shows more of a purplish tinge. The young,
while larger than sparrows, could be confusing
since they are olive-brown above with a buffy
scaled appearance. The underparts show brown
streaking. The female is dusky gray.</p>
<p>They feed near grazing animals and consume
quantities of insects which are disturbed by the
herds. In winter they join other flocking birds
for migration. Then they feed on small seeds.</p>
<p>They build no nest but lay eggs in the nests of
vireos, warblers, sparrows or flycatchers and
depend on the foster parents to rear the young.
The white, evenly speckled-with-brown egg usually
hatches before the eggs of the rightful
owner and the young Cowbird immediately tries
to push the other eggs or young out of the nest.
He wants all the food for himself. Some birds
destroy the unwanted eggs, others desert their
own nest or build a new structure which covers
the eggs, but most species raise the young Cowbird.
Such habits are not condoned in the best
bird circles.</p>
<p>Gurgling notes of the male offer a soothing
note to nature, when flocks of these birds join
other blackbirds in the treetops. The female has
a chattering note which is distinctive.</p>

<br /><i>Piranga rubra</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p12d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="451" height="375" />
</div>
<p>The rosy red plumage of the male Summer
Tanager is helpful in identification for he is
smaller than the Cardinal and lacks the tuft
and black face patch of the latter. Females,
which resemble orioles, do not have the sharply
pointed bill of the oriole and are richer colored
than the female Scarlet Tanager, being almost
an orange-yellow below. She is olive-yellow
above with no wing bars. The wings are greener
than those of her near relative. Young males
often show a mottled pattern of reds and yellows
before attaining the rosy red hue of the
adult.</p>
<p>They prefer a rather open forest such as is
found on hillsides. A dead treetop makes an
ideal perch while singing or catching insects on
the wing. The song is a rather melodious series
of notes which reminds one of a Robin. Alarm
notes are a distinctive series of chippy-tuk-tuk
notes.</p>
<p>These birds feed rather deliberately thru the
trees and destroy many insects and leaf-eating
larvae which they encounter. Their nest is usually
far out on the limb and at least 10 feet
above the ground. They spend winters in South
and Central America. The breeding range does
not extend as far north as that of the Scarlet
Tanager.</p>

<p>Most folks call him a &ldquo;redbird,&rdquo; which is only

black face. No other redbird shows a tuft or
has such a heavy, orange bill. The female is
dressed more in keeping with family duties for
yellowish-brown plumage offers more protection
to her and the secluded nest. She always
shows a reddish tinge especially on the crest,
wings and tail. These markings combined with
the conical reddish beak, leave little doubt as
to identity. The young resemble the female.</p>
<p>The Cardinal, slightly smaller than a Robin,
can be found in almost any area which includes
thickets or tangled vines for protected nesting
sites. Hedges, plum thickets, woodland borders,
city parks, swamps or around your home, any or
all are used on occasion. He likes to feed on small
seeds which means he must venture into the
open, but he wants cover handy, when predators
arrive.</p>
<p>In summer the Cardinal feeds heavily on insects
and larvae but seeds and small fruit form
the major portion of his diet. He is fond of sunflower,
melon or squash seeds and will be among
the first to visit your feeder when these seeds
are offered. If no regular feeder is available, he
will accept food when placed on the ground or
snow.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">With brilliant coat and whistled song,</p>
<p class="t0">A thing of beauty all day long.</p>
<p class="t0">A joy forever you will find,</p>
<p class="t0">If you will keep his wants in mind.</p>

<h3 id="c49">Dickcissel
<br /><i>Spiza americana</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p13a.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="414" height="545" />
</div>
<p>This sparrow-size finch is not too easy to describe
for plumage varies. There is no doubt
about the singing male for he gets his name
from his song and reminds you every few seconds
that he is a Dickcissel. He shows a yellow
breast with a black spot and except for size resembles
a meadowlark. Telephone wires, fences
or weeds offer good perches and there you will
find him with head back and tail hanging down
as he repeats his song. A reddish-brown wing
patch is a good field mark in some seasons. The
female is much like the female English Sparrow
but is lighter with a tinge of yellow and a
lighter eye-line.</p>
<p>Dickcissels are common around fields or
meadows and seem to be especially fond of alfalfa
fields for they offer a good assortment of
beetles, bugs and hoppers on which the bird
thrives. Larvae and small seeds round out the
diet and make this bird a useful neighbor on
any farm.</p>
<p>They nest on or near the ground. This makes
them victims of various predators which range
thru such areas. Cowbirds seem to rely on these
birds to raise their young for they are often
found feeding the young imposters. They wander
widely in both nesting and winter range and
frequently appear where least expected.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In summer when the days are long</p>
<p class="t0">You&rsquo;re bound to hear his cheerful song.</p>
<p class="t0">In open fields, he likes to stay</p>
<p class="t0">And calls his name thruout the day.</p>

<h3 id="c50">American Goldfinch
<br /><i>Spinus tristis</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p13c.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="370" height="641" />
</div>
<p>The American or Common Goldfinch often is
called &ldquo;wild canary.&rdquo; Altho he is not a canary,
his small size, color and twittering notes remind
people of their pets. While smaller than
sparrows, these birds are rugged and winter
over much of their nesting range. Their habit
of flocking and tendency to feed on weed seeds
makes them easily found.</p>
<p>The male of this species is a rich lemon yellow
with a small black mark above the bill,
black wings and tail. The wings show distinct
white bars especially in winter when the yellow
has faded to the more somber hue of the female.
The tail is forked with white tips on the outer
feathers and coverts. The bill is yellow.</p>
<p>Goldfinches are noted for their cheerful dispositions.
A feeding flock can be heard uttering
twittering conversational notes even in winter.
Spring brings the notes of their beautiful but
varied song which usually can be identified as
&ldquo;tzee,&rdquo; or &ldquo;per-chic-o-ree,&rdquo; which is the song
heard when the birds pass overhead.</p>
<p>Goldfinches nest late in the season and use
quantities of thistle down or similar fiber in
building their compact homes. Fondness for
thistles, both seeds and down, often gives him
the name &ldquo;thistle-bird,&rdquo; and many artists picture
him perched on this colorful weed.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He&rsquo;s never happy when alone</p>
<p class="t0">But with the flock is prone to roam.</p>
<p class="t0">You often hear his questioning &ldquo;tzeee&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">In flight he says, &ldquo;per-chic-o-ree.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c51">Slate-colored Junco
<br /><i>Junco hyemalis</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p13d.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="502" height="473" />
</div>
<p>The sparrow-size Slate-colored Junco or the
&ldquo;snowbird,&rdquo; as he frequently is called, is only
a winter visitor in most areas. But what a welcome
guest he is! The white belly and outer tail
feathers add distinctive marks to his slate-gray
plumage. The bill is pinkish white. Females and
immature birds are duller and sometimes show
a pinkish-brown tinge on their backs and sides.</p>
<p>Juncos can be found around weed patches,
hedges or sheltered corners of fields, where they
spend much time in feeding on weed or grass
seeds which provide their winter diet. Even
fallen seeds are not overlooked for these birds
do much of their feeding on the ground. They
sleep in evergreens, sheds or other protected
areas which shelter them from the cold and
snow. They often visit feeders for small seeds
provided by bird lovers.</p>
<p>Their notes are hard to describe but have a
musical smacking or clinking note or series of
notes which once learned, are easily remembered.
Their song is a series of chipping notes
much like those of a Chipping Sparrow, but
with more variation and more of a musical quality.
This song is heard when the first warm days
of spring arrive. They nest in either mountainous
or northern regions for they enjoy cool
climates.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Slate-gray above and white below,</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
